# Predicting the health of trees in New York City
This repository contains the Python code and relative documentation of the first capstone project in the Springboard Data Science Career track. The different phases of the project are documented, together with a final report that includes all of them and presentation slides and pdf. 
The presentation slides can be found here:

# Project description
The project is based on a trees survey in New York City from 2015. The goal is to build a classifier to predict the health of a tree (fair, good or poor) based on some attributes or features. Other objectives are to practice skills such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis.
# Installation
There are no specific requirements to execute the code, the most common Python packages need to be installed. Also, the dataset used in this project needs to be downloaded if executing the code as is:
